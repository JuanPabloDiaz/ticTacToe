# Tic Tac Toe üéÆ

Tic Tac Toe, reborn for the web! Two minds clash on a digital canvas, a 3x3 grid their battlefield. X's and O's, wielded like warriors, dance across the squares, vying for dominance. With each click, tension grows, a web of strategy spun. Can you outsmart your opponent, forge an unyielding line, and declare victory? Or will their cunning counter, leaving your hopes scattered like empty squares? This timeless dance of wit, now in React's embrace, invites you to test your skill, prove your cunning, and crown yourself web-woven champion. Are you ready to play?

## Description üí°

This project was built as part of the **[freeCodeCamp‚Äôs legacy Front End Development Certification]()**. The goal was to build a Tic Tac Toe with React.
